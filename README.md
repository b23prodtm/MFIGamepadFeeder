# MFI Gamepad Feeder

Have you ever wanted to use your MFI (Made for iPhone/iPad) game controller under Windows? With *MFI Gamepad Feeder* it's possible!

## How it works?

*MFI Gamepad Feeder* is a special program that needs to be used in tandem with [ScpVbus](https://github.com/shauleiz/ScpVBus) that creates virtual joystick/gamepad device in your system.

After installing *ScpVbus*, you'll have to use special kind of programs, called *vJoy feeders*, in our case *MFI Gamepad Feeder*.

It looks like modern MFI game controllers are recognized as standrad HID gamepads under Windows, but they're not visible in "USB Game Controllers", so games won't be able to use them. *MFI Gamepad Feeder* is connecting to these "HID gamepads", and it's redirecting raw input from them, directly to the vJoy devices.

On this page I will guide you how to pair it with *MFI Gamepad Feeder*  

## Requirements

Current version of *MFI Gamepad Feeder* requires

* installed [ScpVBus](https://github.com/shauleiz/ScpVBus/releases)
* installed .Net Framework 4.5.2
* supported MFI Gamepad (see list of supported gamepads is listed below)

Application was tested on WIndows 10, but it should work on older systems as well.

## Installation

1. Download and install [MFI Gamepad Feeder](https://github.com/Axadiw/MFIGamepadFeeder/releases/latest "MFI Gamepad Feeder")
2. (optional) Download and install .Net Framework if you don't already have it on your system.
3. Launch *MFI Gamepad Feeder* application, click it's icon in the taskbar in order to maximize it, and select:
	1. Your gamepad from "Gamepad device" list. In my case (Steelseries Nimbus gamepad), gamepad wasn't advertising itself with correct Product name / Manufacturer Name, so I've had to guess which one it was
	2. ID of your vJoy("1" in most cases, 1-4 are possible values)
	3. Correct configuration file (All configuration files are stored in the "Configs" folder in the application folder
	4. Hit Plug/Unplug devices <br/>
